# 🌱 NPK & pH Based Fertilizer Recommendation System

This project processes soil images to estimate **Nitrogen (N)**, **Phosphorus (P)**, **Potassium (K)**, **pH level**, identifies **soil type**, and generates a **fertilizer recommendation**.

It is designed as a backend-friendly pipeline that can be hosted as a service or integrated directly by ML/API teams.
